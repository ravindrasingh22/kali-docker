# Setup your project locally for pentesting
(Its not good practice yo run the pentesting on the prod server or the unauthorized server, its not legal so I am suggesting this to run on local and these instruction will help you to setup the project at local server, try to make the same sever as your project has on public facing).

# Run the demo code
